add `getCrossingPointsBetweenPointAndSegment` method in math
add utils for vector: `getPointByUnitVectorAndVectorComponent`, `getUnitVectorByPointAndPoint`
Use the `getCrossingPointsBetweenPointAndSegment` method to get the associated points (intersection points of the axis and the line segment) that can get points and line segments. It can be used differently from `getNearestPointBetweenPointAndSegment`.
